  <h2>My Assesment</h2>
    <p> The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. clarity is not the same as simpliicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be breif and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.
  </p>
  
  <p2>
    This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does.
  </p2>
  
  <p>
    Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsable for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.
